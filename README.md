# PorousMediaGan3D
The repository contains models for 3D porous media reconstruction from 2D slices.

Two different models are presented: GAN and DDPM.

Pipeline for GAN models training is listed in *training_pipeline_GAN.ipynb* .

Pipeline for DDPM models training is listed in *training_pipeline_diffusion.ipynb* .

Here are some results:
